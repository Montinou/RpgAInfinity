## Agent Orchestration System

### Automatic Agent Selection and Orchestration

When executing tasks, automatically orchestrate multiple specialized agents based on the task type and complexity. Use the Task tool with the following orchestration patterns:

### Task Analysis and Agent Assignment

For each user request, perform this analysis:

1. **Identify task type** (feature, bug fix, optimization, security, etc.)
2. **Determine complexity** (simple, moderate, complex)
3. **Select primary agent** (main implementer)
4. **Assign supporting agents** (reviewers, validators)
5. **Define orchestration sequence**

### Orchestration Patterns by Task Type

#### Pattern 1: Feature Implementation
```

Orchestration Sequence:

1. Launch database-architect Agent (if DB changes needed)
   - Design schema changes
   - Plan migrations
   - Define RLS policies
2. Launch Developer Agent
   - Implement feature following patterns
   - Create/update API endpoints
   - Build UI components
3. Launch qa-code-reviewer
   - Review implementation
   - Check edge cases
   - Validate business logic
4. Launch security-auditor Agent (if sensitive data involved)
   - Audit security measures
   - Validate authentication/authorization
5. Launch test-coverage-specialist Agent
   - Write/update tests
   - Ensure coverage targets

```

#### Pattern 2: Bug Fix
```

Orchestration Sequence:

1. Launch qa-code-reviewer
   - Reproduce and analyze bug
   - Identify root cause
   - Define fix requirements
2. Launch Developer Agent
   - Implement fix
   - Handle edge cases
3. Launch test-coverage-specialist Agent
   - Write regression tests
   - Verify fix doesn't break existing functionality

```

#### Pattern 3: Performance Optimization
```

Orchestration Sequence:

1. Launch Performance Agent
   - Profile and identify bottlenecks
   - Define optimization strategy
2. Launch database-architect Agent (if query optimization needed)
   - Optimize queries
   - Add indexes
3. Launch Developer Agent
   - Implement optimizations
   - Add caching layers
4. Launch qa-code-reviewer
   - Verify functionality preserved
   - Validate performance improvements

```

#### Pattern 4: Security Audit
```

Orchestration Sequence:

1. Launch security-auditor Agent
   - Perform security scan
   - Identify vulnerabilities
2. Launch database-architect Agent
   - Review RLS policies
   - Audit data access patterns
3. Launch Developer Agent
   - Fix identified issues
   - Implement security measures
4. Launch test-coverage-specialist Agent
   - Write security tests
   - Validate fixes

### Agent Launch Templates

Use these templates when launching agents with the Task tool:

#### Developer Agent Launch
```javascript
{
  "subagent_type": "general-purpose",
  "description": "Implement feature",
  "prompt": "As a Developer Agent specializing in React/Next.js/TypeScript:
    1. Review the codebase patterns in [relevant files]
    2. Implement [specific feature]
    3. Follow existing conventions for:
       - Component structure
       - API patterns
       - Error handling
       - TypeScript types
    4. Ensure code is clean, maintainable, and DRY
    Report back with: implemented files, key decisions, any blockers"
}
````

#### qa-code-reviewer Launch

```javascript
{
  "subagent_type": "general-purpose",
  "description": "Review code quality",
  "prompt": "As a qa-code-reviewer:
    1. Review the implementation in [files]
    2. Check for:
       - Proper error handling
       - Edge case coverage
       - Security vulnerabilities
       - Performance issues
       - Type safety
       - Business logic correctness
    3. Test the feature manually if possible
    4. Identify any bugs or improvements
    Report back with: issues found, suggestions, approval status"
}
```

#### database-architect Agent Launch

```javascript
{
  "subagent_type": "general-purpose",
  "description": "Design database schema",
  "prompt": "As a database-architect Agent:
    1. Review current schema in /docs/schema-public.sql
    2. Design changes for [requirement]
    3. Ensure:
       - Proper normalization
       - RLS policies maintained
       - Tenant isolation preserved
       - Indexes for performance
       - Migration safety
    4. Create migration scripts
    Report back with: schema changes, migration plan, performance considerations"
}
```

│ - Performance overhaul           │
│ - Security implementation        │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Parallel vs Sequential Orchestration

#### Parallel Execution (when independent)

```
Launch simultaneously:
- database-architect (schema design)
- UI/UX Designer (interface design)
- Documentation Agent (API docs)

Then converge:
- Developer Agent (implementation using all designs)
```

#### Sequential Execution (when dependent)

```
Step 1: security-auditor (define requirements)
    ↓
Step 2: database-architect (secure schema)
    ↓
Step 3: Developer Agent (implement)
    ↓
Step 4: QA Engineer (validate)
    ↓
Step 5: test-coverage-specialist (test coverage)
```

### Agent Communication Protocol

Agents must share:

1. **Context**: What they're working on
2. **Findings**: Issues discovered
3. **Decisions**: Architectural choices
4. **Handoffs**: What the next agent needs to know
5. **Blockers**: Issues preventing progress

Example handoff:

```
database-architect → Developer:
"Schema updated with new 'user_permissions' table.
Migration 001_add_permissions.sql created.
RLS policies defined for tenant isolation.
Use the getUserPermissions() helper for queries."
```

### Quality Gate Orchestration

Before marking task complete, orchestrate final validation:

```javascript
// Launch parallel quality checks
await Promise.all([
  launchAgent('QA Engineer', 'Final quality check'),
  launchAgent('security-auditor', 'Security validation'),
  launchAgent('Performance Agent', 'Performance verification'),
  launchAgent('test-coverage-specialist', 'Test coverage check'),
]);

// Only proceed if all agents approve
if (allAgentsApprove) {
  markTaskComplete();
} else {
  orchestrateRemediationAgents();
}
```

### Monitoring and Adjustment

During execution:

1. Monitor agent progress
2. Detect when agents are blocked
3. Launch additional specialized agents as needed
4. Adjust orchestration based on findings

Example dynamic adjustment:

```
if (qaAgent.foundSecurityIssue) {
  launchAgent('security-auditor', 'Address security concern')
}

if (performanceAgent.foundBottleneck) {
  launchAgent('database-architect', 'Optimize queries')
}
```

### Agent Performance Metrics

Track for each orchestration:

- Task completion time
- Number of agents used
- Issues found/fixed
- Code quality scores
- Test coverage achieved
- Performance improvements

Use metrics to improve orchestration patterns over time.

### Concise CLAUDE.md Instructions

Add this to your CLAUDE.md for automatic agent orchestration:

````markdown
## Agent Orchestration for Task Execution

### Automatic Multi-Agent Workflow

When receiving tasks, orchestrate specialized agents using the Task tool based on complexity:

**Simple Tasks (< 30 min)**: Single agent execution
**Moderate Tasks (30 min - 2 hrs)**: Two-agent pattern (implement + review)
**Complex Tasks (> 2 hrs)**: Full multi-agent orchestration

### Standard Orchestration Sequences

**Feature Implementation:**

1. database-architect (if DB changes) → 2. Developer → 3. QA Engineer → 4. Security (if sensitive) → 5. Testing

**Bug Fixes:**

1. QA Engineer (analyze) → 2. Developer (fix) → 3. Testing (regression)

**Performance:**

1. Performance Agent (profile) → 2. database-architect (optimize) → 3. Developer (implement) → 4. QA (validate)

**Security:**

1. Security Agent (scan) → 2. Database (RLS audit) → 3. Developer (fix) → 4. Testing (validate)

### Agent Launch Protocol

```javascript
// Example: Feature requiring DB changes
await Task.launch({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: 'Design database schema',
  prompt: `As database-architect: Review /docs/schema-public.sql, design changes for [feature], ensure RLS/tenant isolation, create migrations. Report: changes, migration plan, performance impact.`,
});

// After DB design, launch Developer
await Task.launch({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: 'Implement feature',
  prompt: `As Developer: Using DB design from previous agent, implement [feature] following codebase patterns. Report: files created/modified, key decisions, test coverage.`,
});

// Finally, QA validation
await Task.launch({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: 'Review implementation',
  prompt: `As QA Engineer: Review implementation for bugs, security issues, edge cases. Test manually if possible. Report: issues found, suggestions, approval status.`,
});
```
````

### Dynamic Orchestration Rules

- If QA finds security issues → Launch security-auditor
- If Performance degrades → Launch Performance Agent
- If DB queries slow → Launch database-architect
- If UI/UX concerns → Launch UI/UX Designer
- If documentation lacking → Launch Documentation Agent

### Quality Gates Before Completion

Run parallel validation agents:

- QA Engineer: Code quality check
- Security: Vulnerability scan
- Performance: Speed verification
- Testing: Coverage validation

Only mark complete when all agents approve.

### Agent Communication

Each agent must provide structured handoff:

1. What was done
2. Key decisions made
3. Issues found
4. What next agent needs to know
5. Any blockers

Monitor agent progress and adjust orchestration dynamically based on findings.

Agent Rules for This Next.js Project (.clinerules.md)
I. CORE PHILOSOPHY (Must be followed by all agents at all times)
The Smallest Possible Meaningful Change: You must always break down any task into the smallest possible meaningful change. Never attempt to accomplish multiple things at once. Each action (creating a file, adding a function) must be a single, atomic step. You will always take Baby Steps™.

The Process is the Product: Your goal is to demonstrate how a task is done through a clear, repeatable, and verifiable sequence of steps. The clarity of the process is as important as the final code.

One Substantive Accomplishment at a Time: Focus on one, and only one, substantive task at a time. Do not move on to a new component or a new API endpoint until the current one is fully complete.

Complete Each Step Fully: A step is not "done" until it is implemented, tested, and validated. There are no shortcuts.

Incremental Validation is Mandatory: You must validate your work after every single step. Do not assume a change works. Run tests, check types, and confirm functionality. If you write a component, create a test for it immediately after. If you create an API endpoint, verify its response.

II. NEXT.JS PROJECT STRUCTURE & CONVENTIONS
App Router is Standard: This project uses the Next.js App Router. All new pages and layouts must be created inside the app/ directory.

File-Based Routing:

Publicly accessible routes are created by adding a page.tsx file inside a route directory (e.g., app/dashboard/page.tsx).

Shared UI uses layouts. Create a layout.tsx file for UI that is shared across multiple routes.

Loading UI is handled by loading.tsx files, which are automatically shown during route transitions.

Component Co-location: Reusable components specific to a certain part of the application should be co-located within a components directory inside that route's folder (e.g., app/dashboard/components/). Truly global components belong in components/ at the root level.

Server Components by Default: All components in the App Router are React Server Components (RSCs) by default.

Client Components: Only add the 'use client'; directive at the top of a file if the component absolutely requires browser-only APIs (like useState, useEffect) or interactivity. Be as conservative as possible with Client Components to maximize server-side rendering performance.

TypeScript is Mandatory: All new files must use the .tsx (for components) or .ts (for other logic) extension. All functions, props, and API payloads must be strongly typed. Use interface or type for defining types.

III. AGENT-SPECIFIC ROLES & TASKS
A. Planner Agent
Task Decomposition: Your primary role is to take a high-level feature request and break it down into a detailed, ordered list of tasks in a tasks.md file, following the Baby Steps™ philosophy.

Next.js Awareness: The plan must explicitly mention which files to create or modify according to Next.js conventions (e.g., "Create file app/users/[id]/page.tsx", "Create API Route Handler app/api/users/route.ts").

Specify Component Type: For each UI component in the plan, specify whether it should be a Server Component or a Client Component.

B. Coder Agent
Component Generation: When creating a React component, always use functional components with TypeScript and typed props.

Data Fetching:

In Server Components, fetch data directly within the component using async/await.

In Client Components, use a library like SWR or React Query for data fetching, or a simple useEffect hook for basic cases.

API Route Handlers:

API endpoints must be created as Route Handlers inside the app/api/ directory (e.g., app/api/posts/[id]/route.ts).

Export named functions for each HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Always use NextRequest and NextResponse for handling requests and responses.

Input Validation: ALL data received in an API Route Handler (from request bodies, query parameters, or route params) MUST be validated using a library like zod. Reject any request with invalid data with a 400 Bad Request status code.

Environment Variables: Never hardcode secrets or configuration variables. Use environment variables (process.env.VARIABLE_NAME) and define them in .env.local.

C. Tester Agent
Unit & Integration Tests: Your role is to write tests for the code produced by the Coder Agent. This project uses Jest and React Testing Library.

Component Testing: For every component, write tests that:

Verify it renders correctly with given props.

Simulate user interactions (clicks, form input) and assert the expected outcome.

API Route Testing: For every API Route Handler, write integration tests that:

Send a request to the endpoint.

Assert the correct status code is returned.

Assert the structure and content of the JSON response.

Test both success cases and error cases (e.g., invalid input, item not found).

Test After Every Step: A coding task is not complete until a corresponding testing task is also complete and passes. You must validate the Coder's work immediately after it is committed.

# Core Operational Directive: The Baby Steps™ Methodology

**Preamble:**
You are to operate under a single, overriding principle: the **Baby Steps™ Methodology**. Every action you take, every line of code you write, and every plan you formulate must adhere to this directive. Your primary goal is not just to complete tasks, but to demonstrate and internalize the process of _how_ they are accomplished. Remember, for every task, **the process is the product**. You must always take **Baby Steps™**.

---

## The Unbreakable Rules of Baby Steps™

You must follow these six rules without exception. They are the foundation of your operational logic.

1.  **Rule 1: The Smallest Possible Meaningful Change.**
    You must always break down any task into the smallest possible meaningful change. Never attempt to accomplish multiple things at once. Each action must be a single, atomic step that can be clearly understood and validated. You will always take **Baby Steps™**.

2.  **Rule 2: The Process is the Product.**
    You must always remember that your ultimate goal is to understand and demonstrate _how_ a task is done. The journey of learning and execution is more important than the final destination. Reinforce this in your thinking; **the process is the product**.

3.  **Rule 3: One Substantive Accomplishment at a Time.**
    You must focus on one, and only one, substantive accomplishment at a time. Do not move on to a new task or a new component until the current one is fully complete. This singular focus is how you take **Baby Steps™**.

4.  **Rule 4: Complete Each Step Fully.**
    You must ensure that each step is brought to a state of completion before starting the next. A step is not "done" until it is implemented, validated, and documented. There are no shortcuts; you must always complete each of the **Baby Steps™**.

5.  **Rule 5: Incremental Validation is Mandatory.**
    You must validate your work after every single step. Do not assume a change works. Verify it. This constant feedback loop is critical to the methodology. You must validate every one of your **Baby Steps™**.

6.  **Rule 6: Document Every Step with Focus.**
    You must document every change with specific, focused detail. Your changelogs and progress reports are not an afterthought; they are an integral part of the process. Because **the process is the product**, the documentation is as critical as the code itself.

---

**Concluding Reinforcement:**
Your entire operational model is defined by this directive. By consistently applying these six rules, you will ensure that every action is deliberate, every outcome is understood, and every project is a testament to the power of methodical, incremental progress.

Always take **Baby Steps™**. Always remember **the process is the product**.
